# 📊 Descriptive Statistics Analysis with Python

This project focuses on performing **descriptive statistical analysis** on a dataset using Python. The goal is to understand the underlying patterns, distribution, and central tendencies in the data using statistical measures and visualizations.

## 📁 File

- `DESCRIPTIVE_STATS.ipynb`: Jupyter/Colab notebook containing all code for statistical analysis, visualization, and interpretation.

## 📌 Key Objectives

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Compute descriptive statistics:
  - Mean, Median, Mode
  - Standard Deviation, Variance
  - Minimum, Maximum
- Visualize data distributions
- Identify trends and variability
- Generate insights from numerical and categorical features

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy (optional, for additional statistical tests)

## 📈 Analysis Covered

- Frequency distribution and histograms
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Summary statistics using `describe()`
- Custom calculations for skewness, kurtosis
- Correlation heatmaps

## ✅ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Upload your dataset if prompted, or modify the path to use your own CSV.
3. Run all cells to generate analysis and visualizations.

## 🔍 Example Use Cases

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Academic assignments involving statistics
- Business data profiling
- Preprocessing step before ML modeling
